# WeCare
WeCare is a comprehensive multiservice wearable belt integrated with an Android app, a motivation to help the visually impaired elderly suffering from cataract/glaucoma.

It brings a plethora of features at just 5% the cost.

Have an Ola or Uber for a joyous ride? Why not use the same technology to send a request notification to all the near proximity users on the app instead of just his relatives (who perchance may not be able to provide faster relief in emergency). Such users will then indicate their willingness and ability to help and accordingly the nearest user will be mapped.
